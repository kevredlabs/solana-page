# How to do Liquid Staking with The Vault


!!! 
This tutorial assumes you already know what is liquid staking. If you don't, please read "What is Staking ?" first. 
!!!

This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to stake Solana (SOL) to Kevred using The Vault.

The Vault is a liquid staking protocol that allows users to stake their SOL while still benefiting from the liquidity of their assets. It is a well known protocol that has about 1M SOL staked to more than 100 validators.
vSOL is the liquid staking token that represents your staked SOL, its value increases over time because the pool earns staking rewards.

If you want to know more about the Vault, you can read their documentation [here](https://docs.thevault.finance/) or join their discord. They have a very active community and a very good support.





## Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have a Solana compatible wallet like Solflare, Phantom, etc.
- Make sure you have some vSOL in your wallet. You can swap some SOL to vSOL on [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-vSOL).
- Make sure to understand the concept of liquid staking.




## Steps to Stake SOL to Kevred with the Vault

### Step 1: Open the Vault direct stake page

### Step 3: Select the Kevred Validator
- Solflare will display a list of available validators. These validators are nodes that process transactions and support the Solana network.
- Write "kevred" in the search bar to find the Kevred Validator. Solflare validator is recommended by the wallet by default but you can choose another one (ours had a better APY when I did the tutorial)

## Additional Tips
- **Validator Selection**: Choosing a reliable validator is crucial as it affects your staking rewards.
- **Liquidity**: Keep in mind that staked SOL are not immediately liquid. There is a cooldown period if you decide to withdraw your funds from staking.

By following this tutorial, you can actively support the Solana network while earning staking rewards. Happy staking with us !
